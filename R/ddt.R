#' The DDT data set
#'
#' The sampling method used for the DDT data set regarding fish contamination in the Tennessee River was a designed experiment involving stratified sampling. Key details regarding the sampling design include:The data collection method is explicitly identified as a designed experiment, one involving a stratified sample.The different river and tributary creek locations (Tennessee River, Flint Creek, Limestone Creek, and Spring Creek) represented the different strata for the study.The Corps of Engineers specifically made sure to collect samples of fish at each of these river and tributary creek locations. The sample consisted of 144 fish specimens in total. Specifically, six fish specimens were captured at each of the three tributary creeks, and 126 specimens were collected at various locations along the Tennessee River.
